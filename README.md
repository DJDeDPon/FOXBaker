# FOXBaker

This app created for bake-sub-to-video. It provides a simple graphical user interface to hardcode (or "burn") an `.ass` or `.srt` subtitle file into a video.

## Requirements

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed and configured on your system.

**Python**

This project requires Python 3.10. You can download it here:
[Download Python 3.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100/)

**FFmpeg**

This application depends on FFmpeg to perform all video processing.

1.  Download FFmpeg from the official website: [ffmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)
2.  Unzip the downloaded file to a location on your computer (for example, `C:\ffmpeg`).
3.  You must add the `bin` folder from within the FFmpeg directory (e.g., `C:\ffmpeg\bin`) to your system's PATH environment variable. This is a critical step that allows the application to execute FFmpeg commands.

A guide on how to add a folder to your PATH on Windows can be found [here](https://www.architectryan.com/2018/03/17/add-to-the-path-on-windows-10/).

## Usage

Run the provided executable file (`FOXBaker.exe`).
